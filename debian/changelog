  [ Tzafrir Cohen ]
  * Initial release. (Closes: #722093)

  [ Petter Reinholdtsen ]
  * New patch keep-vendor-dir.diff to avoid removing directories that
    should survive the clean Makefile target.
  * Add workaround in rules addressing the problem caused by
    keep-vendor-dir.diff being applied after 'make clean' is executed.
  * New patch sudo-not-exmachina.diff to drop the exmachina dependency,
    and adjust binary dependencies and the debpathes patch to cope with
    this.  Drop dependency on augeas-tools, no longer used with this
    patch.
  * Set priority to optional, as the package do not conflict with anything.
