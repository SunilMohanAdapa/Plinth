  <p>For security reasons, neither WAN Administration nor WAN SSH is
    available to the `admin` user account.</p>

  <p>TODO: in expert mode, tell user they can ssh in to enable admin
    from WAN, do their business, then disable it.  It would be good to
    enable the option and autodisable it when the ssh connection
    dies.</p>
