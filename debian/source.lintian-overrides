# This is a consequnce of bug in jsxc
# https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=838183. While is is possible
# to change the upstream Plinth code to remove the links and create during
# installation, the jsxc module in Plinth will stop working in certain modes of
# development. We belive the proper fix for the problem is to fix the above
# issue.
